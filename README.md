# Mini_SIP_server (Rust)

[![CI](https://github.com/binlin1973/Mini_SIP_server_RUST/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/binlin1973/Mini_SIP_server_RUST/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A **lightweight SIP signaling server** written in Rust.  
Implements the complete SIP call flow — from the initial `INVITE` and `180 Ringing`, to `200 OK`, `ACK`, and `BYE`.  
It focuses purely on SIP **signaling and call control**, not RTP media forwarding.

## 🧩 Overview

`Mini_SIP_server (Rust)` is designed for learning, testing, and integration purposes.  
It lets any standard SIP softphone (e.g., **Linphone**, **MicroSIP**, **Zoiper**) register and make peer-to-peer calls.

The server runs as a single lightweight binary and stores user registration information in memory.

## ⚙️ Build & Run

### 1. Configure Server IP

Before building, open [`sip_defs.rs`](./src/sip_defs.rs) and set your actual server IP address:

pub const SIP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS: &str = "192.168.32.131"; // Example — change to your machine's IP

### 2. Build

cargo clean

cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl

### 3. Run
./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/sip_server_rust

By default, the server listens on UDP port 5060.


## ⚙️ Softphone Configuration
Any standard SIP softphone can connect to this server.

### Setting	Example	Description
| Setting                | Example              | Description                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **SIP Server / Proxy** | `192.168.32.131`    | Replace with your server IP |
| **Port**               | `5060`               | Default UDP port            |
| **Username**           | `1001` – `1006`      | Any user ID in this range   |
| **Password**           | any non-empty string | Password is not validated   |
| **Transport**          | `UDP`                | Required                    |


### Example (MicroSIP)
| Field        | Value           |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Account name | 1001            |
| SIP server   | 192.168.32.131 |
| User         | 1001            |
| Domain       | 192.168.32.131 |
| Password     | 1234            |
| Transport    | UDP             |

##  📞 Making a Call

Register two clients, e.g.:

Client A → 1001

Client B → 1002

From Client A, dial 1002

Client B will ring and can answer the call.

You’ll see the full SIP signaling printed in the server console:

INVITE → 100 Trying → 180 Ringing → 200 OK → ACK → BYE → 200 OK
